# CodeJamIO
Hi!
Today I participated on the CodeJamIO for Women,  It was interesting 3 hours of competition is hard, I think I have to improve my skills in order to solve the problems faster.

I completed two solutions, and you can see them in this folder.

If you want to check the problems you can check them here:

- https://demo.codimd.org/kVcKtFu0Sjy4sF0FOfAo2A
- https://demo.codimd.org/s/rybJRsSmL

You can also go the official website of Google competitions here: https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejamio/round/000000000019ff03

I am not really sure if my solutions counted, because I do not understand very well the Google Competitions UI.

I clicked the submmit attempt button, I hope that is enough, but I do not see my score yet 🤷‍♀️ and after that I got this answer:

I will wait and let you know how this went! :)
